                <dt>Seattle Takes on the Rams next week</dt>
                <dd>- Rams have gotten off to slow start this season. Even though their record shows a solid 3-1, their play does not back that up</dd>
                <dt>Seattle is relatively injury free</dt>
                <dd>- After starting off the season banged up, most of the team is healthy. Other than the normal veteran off day, only Ethan Pocic remains on the injury report.</dd>
